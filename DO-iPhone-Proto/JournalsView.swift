It's refreshing to step away from the daily grind and catch up with old friends. We talked about her new job at the tech startup, my recent travels, and how much has changed since college. Time flies but good friendships remain constant.

We went to that little Italian place downtown that we used to love. The food was just as good as I remembered - I had the seafood linguine and Emily got her usual margherita pizza. We split a tiramisu for dessert, just like old times.

The best part was just being able to talk without any agenda. No work calls, no rushing to the next meeting. Just two friends catching up over good food and wine. We laughed about old memories and made plans to not let so much time pass before our next get-together.

Days like this remind me how important it is to nurture these relationships. Work will always be there, but friends like Emily are rare and precious.

Felt energized after a good night's sleep. The weather was perfect for running and I managed to do my full 5K route without stopping. The park was peaceful at this early hour, with just a few other runners and dog walkers out.

Saw the usual group of older folks doing tai chi by the pond. Always makes me smile. There's such a nice community feel to the park in the mornings. Everyone waves or nods as they pass by.

Finished with some stretching by the fountain. Feeling ready to tackle whatever the day brings!
